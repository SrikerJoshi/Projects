project 1:  Atom-Efficient tracking, monitoring, and orchestration of cloud resources
            Developed a mock web model for a cloud-based architecture where Principal Component Analysis approach was used to find anomalies in the cloud resources and the backend works by VM Clustering.
project 2 : An Improvised Mobile Search Engine
            Implemented a cloud-based search engine that uses a spatial inverted index to identify the node, in this case, a restaurant when we give keywords like a dish name or location in the search bar and the search engine returns the nearest matching locations which serve the dish. It is based on NNS (Nearest Neighbor Search)
project 3 : FPS game based on Our college
            Designed and created using I-clone-8 to design the game environment and used Modeling software like blender and crazy talk to model characters and used Maximo for auto rigging and built the prototype of the game on the UNITY platform.
