## 📂 [AI-Based LLM chatbots](.SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/AI%20based%20LLM%20Chatbots) <a name="AI-based LLM Chatbots"></a> 
**Description:**  
This project attempts to build AI-based chatbots to use custom data as context for a LLM chatbot, which helps users know more about my resume.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: it is straightforward to understand.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine or kaggle.
- Feature 3: I do not have API keys for all the LLM services but I have included how you can make the Chatbot run on your local system or on Kaggle without much hassle.
- Feature 4: These models are just for simply trying out building your custom chatbots, These are command line and do not have a web interface but they can be easily built using Streamlit which is shown in the implementation of one of the chatbots.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Google Gemini  
- Open AI  
- OLLAMA
- Streamlit
