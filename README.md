## 📂 [AI-Based LLM chatbots](.SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/AI%20based%20LLM%20Chatbots) <a name="AI-based LLM Chatbots"></a> 
**Description:**  
This project attempts to build AI-based chatbots to use custom data as context for various LLMs for building your chatbot, Here I have shown examples of building chatbots that help users know more about my resume.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: It is straightforward to understand.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine or kaggle.
- Feature 3: I do not have API keys for all the LLM services but I have included how you can make the Chatbot run on your local system or on Kaggle without much hassle.
- Feature 4: These models are just for simply trying out building your custom chatbots, These are command line and do not have a web interface but they can be easily built using Streamlit which is shown in the implementation of one of the chatbots.

**LLMs Used:**  
- Google Gemini  
- Open AI  
- OLLAMA
- Streamlit

## 📂 [Deep learning projects](.SrikerJoshi/Projects/tree/main/Deep%20learning%20projects) <a name="Deep learning projects"></a> 
**Description:**  
These projects attempt to showcase various Deep learning concepts to do classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset and I have shown how various models are better at doing various tasks when it comes to models when performing certain tasks, here I have considered classification as my primary task and used various methods to optimize the model to train better on the dataset to be able to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset. You can find what are the optimization techniques I have used along with detailed reports encompassing my approach. There is also a Custom CNN I have built to train the model to do Blood cell classification as well.

**Main Features:**
- Feature 1: It is straightforward to understand and detailed reports explain what happened while I was working on each model.
- Feature 2: You can run these on your local machine or Kaggle, I have included the HTML pages to be able to see how the code performed.
- Feature 3: These are just touching the surface of deep learning and you can find so many more projects like these on kaggle.

**Models Used:**  
- liner classifier 
- 2 - layer neural network  
- CNN
- KNN
- Custom CNN
